                Welcome!
                The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around 
                since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase 
                efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted the flooding 
                of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working in data science 
                have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do. 
                This field is data science. In this course, we will meet some data science 
                practitioners and we will get an overview of what data science is today.<br>
